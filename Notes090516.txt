BUGS:
Liars have no location on their 2nd clue.
Statement tokens not properly serialized
	- "The murderer is a [gender]"
	- One statement contains token '[him]'(?)
Accusations against liars count even if liar has already caved
Almost all liars have Accusational truth statements.

SUGGESTIONS:
Add color descriptors to torso pieces.
Arrest possibility before end of day should be obvious.
