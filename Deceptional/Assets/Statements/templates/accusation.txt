Blimey! [Z] said [Q[2]] was puttin' up [Q[3]] laundry an' saw da murderer, but I fnk [Q[2]] just wan' attenshun. Nuff said, yeah?
Blimey! Why are yew askin' me? I did not do anything. But I am not so sure abaaaht [Z], [Q[2]] just seem so shady. Nuff said, yeah?
Awright geeezzaa! Don't talk ter me, talk ter [Z] [Q[2]] is braggin' abaaaht almost catchin' da murderer. Sorted mate.
Now I do not put much value in gossip, but I 'eard [Z] cannot 'elp, [Q[2]] always lies fer da fun ov it! OK?
I 'eard abaaaht da murder from [Z], [Q[2]] told me [Q[2]] saw da murderer an' what da murderer looked [Q[5]] straight in da eye... But I'm not sure abaaaht what part. OK?
I 'eard what [Z] actually searched da victim fer valuables befawer da police arrived, [Q[2]] is such a immoral sneak!
Blimey! I saw nothing, yew can ask [Z] cause I was warmin' [Q[2]] bed. Homeless [Z] might 'ave seen somethin' if [Q[2]] was sober enuff ter see straight. Nuff said, yeah?
[Q[4]] are liars... All ov 'em, they cannot be trusted. Just take [Z] fer instance, [Q[2]] just like ter be da cen'er ov attenshun., innit.
So little [Q[6]]-know-it-all says what [Q[2]] is certain what [Q[2]] saw da \"real\" murderer, I doubt it, [Z] just fnk [Q[2]] is so clever... [Q[2]] is not! Sorted mate.
