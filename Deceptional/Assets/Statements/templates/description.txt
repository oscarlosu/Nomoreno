When I opened me door dis mornin' I was shoved back in by a big [Q[1]], I saw [Q[2]] 'ad a [X] [Y].
When I got up dis mornin' someone 'ad crashed in ter me flaaahrs, there was a [X] piece ov clof stuck ter 'em., innit.
I was emptyin' da night pot, an' I saw two [Q[4]] strugglin' in da street, da [Q[1]] standin' over da uvver 'ad a [X] [Y]. But I did not buvver ter get involved.
Awright geeezzaa! I saw da murder 'appen! I was so scared, I 'id benearf da windowsill, I was shaking! I peaked up an' saw a [X] [Y] turning, an' quickly ducked down again! Sorted mate.
I was comin' aaaht ov da pub ter take a piss, when I noticed dis big [Q[1]] passin' by lookin' shady. I greeted [Q[5]], but da dow' said nothing. [Q[2]] 'ad a [X] [Y] on. Know what I mean?
I was groomin' da 'orse when somethin' scared 'em, I looked around an' saw a [Q[1]] standin' over [Q[1]]. I turned ter calm da 'orse, when I looked again there was only one [Q[1]] lyin' facedown in da street. The uvver [Q[1]] 'ad [X] [Y].
I was openin' me shop, I 'eard some commoshun in da street, when I wen' ter look I just saw a glimpse ov da murderer's [Y] which was [X].
