Tick tack da time goes, yew fumble now [name] tumbled
Thee are like little mouse in me maze, [name] is now erased
I 'ad a lovely meet an' greet, [name]'ll fawerver sleep
Never again, never again, shall [name]’s day begin
I took my liberty, I ended [name] deliberately
In a pool ov blood, [name] was dropped
[name] was a bi' ov a pest, now in a grave [gender[5]] rest
After a good 'ack an' slash, I left [name]'s dead body in a dash
Tiresome is da work ov killing, when all ov [name]'s guts was spilling.
[name] cried when I stuck, guess [gender[2]] was shi' aaaht ov luck
Talk all yew wan' wiv da sheep, but I 'ad ter put [name] ter sleep
I creep an' stack me prey, [name] I just 'ad ter slay
I am bawerd ter dearf, so I made [name] take [gender] last brearf
[name] was 'appy an' glad, killin' [gender] was not what bad
[name] knew nothing, i' was fun ter see [gender[3]] blood gushing
[name] lost [gender[5]] life today, [gender[2]] was ain't da most in'erestin' prey
The time goes by an' yew are no closer, 'ad kill [name] what poser
I am sorry what [name] 'ad ter die, I cut [gender[5]] down wiv 'eavy sigh
Please catch me, I cannot stop, [name] I killed wiv one chop
I am disappoin'ed, they die so quick, [name]'s blood flowed fck
I just cannot get i' right, da rope around [name]'s neck must 'ave been an' all tight
[gender[5]] begged an' pleaded, [name]'s dearf did not give me what I needed
Try as I might, I could not get [name]'s dearf right
I feel unfulfilled, what [name]'s dearf could not make me mawer frilled
Why are deese people so useless? Or da [name]'s dearf simply remind me ov 'ubris?
